  /* This class employs concurrent workers that perform the following cycle:
   *
   *   1. Collect all available request-response pairs from the queue up to `BATCH_SIZE`.
   *   2. Execute the collected pairs as a batch.
   *
   * We guarantee that every submitted request is handled. The following traces all possible paths a
   * request-response pair can take through the batcher to demonstrate this guarantee.
   *
   * Possible Paths:
   *
   *   1. The pair is present in some `submit` call.
   *   2. The pair is enqueued, but not yet reflected in the request-responses count.
   *   3. The pair is enqueued, and request-responses count has been incremented.
   *
   * Step 1: Initial part of `submit`
   *
   * A. We check the active-workers count. If it's less than `targetWorkerCount`, a new worker is
   *    started and the pair is directly assigned to it.
   *
   * B. Otherwise, we enqueue the pair. When the queue is full, we sleep and try again until
   *    enqueuing succeeds. After enqueuing, we proceed to Step 2.
   *
   * Case A bypasses Step 2, and the pair is immediately assigned a worker.
   *
   * Step 2: Request-response Enqueued
   *
   * Step 2 is not atomic with Step 1, so the counters might have changed. We re-check
   * active-workers count.
   *
   * A. If it's already at `targetWorkerCount`, we attempt to increment request-responses count
   *    atomically, ensuring active-workers count remains unchanged during the increment. Success
   *    leads to Step 3.
   *
   * B. If active-workers count is below the target (due to concurrent activity), we start a new
   *    worker like in Step 1, and dequeue an arbitrary element to assign to it. This maintains
   *    consistency between queue size and request-responses count. The new worker guarantees
   *    processing of all enqueued request-responses (including the one we just added), even if that
   *    specific request ends up handled by a different worker.
   *
   * Step 3: Request-response Enqueued and request-responses count Incremented
   *
   * The atomic request-responses count increment only happens in Step 2 if active-workers count is
   * already at the target. Workers only stop if request-responses count is 0. Since
   * `targetWorkerCount` > 0, there's always at least one active worker to handle the
   * request-response.
